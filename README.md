# OS - Surveillance | Offensive OSINT

## Project Overview

OS - Surveillance is a web project designed to showcase a visually stunning background animation using Three.js, while providing a clean user interface for users to interact with. It focuses on delivering actionable intelligence from real-time data, making it a valuable tool for Offensive OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) applications.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/os-surveillance.git
   cd os-surveillance
   ```

2. **Open `index.html`:**
   Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can also serve the files using a local server (like `Live Server` in VSCode) to avoid CORS issues with grouped resources.

## Usage

Once you open the `index.html` file, you will see an animated background with particles. Moving your mouse will affect the rotation of the particle system, creating an interactive experience. This enhances the visual appeal while providing a foundational structure for further development in data visualization and analytics.

## Features

- Interactive 3D particle animation using Three.js.
- Responsive design that adjusts to different screen sizes.
- Clean UI with Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Easily extendable for future functionalities related to surveillance data.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following libraries:

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) - For rendering 3D graphics.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling the user interface.
- [OrbitControls](https://threejs.org/examples/#misc_controls_orbit) - To control camera movements (though not used explicitly in the code, included for potential future features).
